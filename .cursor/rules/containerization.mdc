- All development must happen in Docker containers
- Use `docker compose exec app ...` to execute commands in the container
- Files (source files, logs, backups, output etc.) can be accessed directly, without the need of docker (compose) exec, on the current project directory
- To build Docker container images use `docker buildx bake -f compose.yml`
