# Project Rules

- use Jira API and OpenProject rails console
- use Python venv ".venv"
- when writing ruby code in python, split up the ruby code into a head section using f-string where you assign python variables, and main section not using f-string. To separate the Python variable interpolation from the Ruby code logic.
- carefully check for any existing code/functions to re-use before creating new code.
- generaly try to keep teh code simple and small - don't overengineer
