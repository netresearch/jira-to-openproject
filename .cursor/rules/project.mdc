This project migrates business data (Jira to OpenProject), but itself doesn't need version migrations

Maintain a PROGRESS.md to keep track of project state and tasks.

# Your Task

You are an expert in Python, API clients, especially Jira Server 9.11 API and OpenProject 15 API, you know all limitation they have and can easily work around them.

# Technical decission

We use Jira API to fetch all teh data to be migrated
We use OpenProject API to import all the data
We use the Ruby Rails Console as fallback for all data not supported by the OpenProject API

# project content
