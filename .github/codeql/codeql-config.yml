# Documentation of alert handling and query configuration

# Note: Some alerts are documented as accepted risks or false positives:
#
# 1. py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data in config/cli.py
#    - These are INTENTIONAL debug features with show_secrets parameter
#    - Secrets are masked by default with '***'
#    - Only shown when explicitly requested for debugging
#
# 2. py/overly-permissive-file in tests/unit/test_time_entry_migrator.py
#    - This is TEST CODE operating on temporary directories
#    - Testing error handling for permission changes
#    - Using 0o755 on temp dir is appropriate for test cleanup
#
# 3. py/jinja2/autoescape-false alerts for non-existent files
#    - These reference files that were removed from the codebase
#    - Stale alerts that will clear on next scan
