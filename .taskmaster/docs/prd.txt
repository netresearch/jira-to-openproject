- Implement resource monitoring and throttling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Migration speed improved by at least 50% for large datasets
- Memory usage remains stable during large migrations
- System can handle 100k+ items without performance degradation
- Parallel processing doesn't overwhelm target systems

### Task 105: Add Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Implement structured logging with different log levels, log rotation, and integration with monitoring systems. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring.

**Requirements:**
- Implement structured logging with JSON format
- Add log rotation and archival
- Create log aggregation and search capabilities
- Implement metrics collection (Prometheus format)
- Add health check endpoints
- Create log analysis tools

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All operations are logged with appropriate detail levels
- Logs are searchable and filterable
- Metrics are available for monitoring systems
- Log files are automatically rotated and archived

### Task 106: Implement Rollback and Undo Capabilities
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Create a comprehensive rollback system that can undo migrations at various levels (individual items, batches, or entire components) while maintaining data integrity.

**Requirements:**
- Implement transaction-based rollback for individual items
- Add batch rollback capabilities
- Create component-level rollback (e.g., rollback all users)
- Implement rollback validation and safety checks
- Add rollback progress tracking
- Create rollback history and audit trail

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Individual items can be rolled back safely
- Batch rollbacks maintain referential integrity
- Rollback operations are logged and auditable
- System prevents unsafe rollback operations

### Task 107: Add Configuration Management and Templates
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Create a flexible configuration management system with templates for common migration scenarios, environment-specific configurations, and validation rules.

**Requirements:**
- Implement configuration templates for common scenarios
- Add environment-specific configuration support
- Create configuration validation
- Implement configuration versioning
- Add configuration import/export capabilities
- Create configuration documentation generator

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can use predefined templates for common scenarios
- Configuration is validated before use
- Multiple environment configurations are supported
- Configuration changes are versioned and tracked

### Task 108: Implement Advanced Security Features
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Enhance security by implementing encryption for sensitive data, secure credential management, audit logging, and access control mechanisms.

**Requirements:**
- Implement encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Add secure credential management (vault integration)
- Create audit logging for all operations
- Implement role-based access control
- Add API rate limiting and throttling

- Credentials are stored securely
- All operations are audited
- Access is controlled based on user roles
- System is protected against common security threats

### Task 109: Add Integration Testing Framework
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Create a comprehensive integration testing framework that can test the entire migration pipeline with real or mock data, including end-to-end testing scenarios.
