# Task ID: 25
# Title: Update OpenProjectClient to Own and Initialize All Clients
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the OpenProjectClient to act as the top-level component that initializes and owns SSHClient, DockerClient, and RailsConsoleClient in the correct hierarchical order.
# Details:
• Refactor OpenProjectClient constructor (or initialization method) to remove any external client instantiation and instead manage its own instances.
• Step 1: Instantiate SSHClient with the existing configuration parameters and assign it to a private member (e.g. this.sshClient).
• Step 2: Instantiate DockerClient, passing the previously created SSHClient as a dependency (e.g. new DockerClient(this.sshClient)), and store it (e.g. this.dockerClient).
• Step 3: Instantiate RailsConsoleClient, passing the DockerClient instance (e.g. new RailsConsoleClient({ docker_client: this.dockerClient })), and store it (e.g. this.railsConsoleClient).
• Remove any fallback logic inside dependent clients for self-instantiation to avoid duplication; ensure they rely solely on the injected dependencies.
• Update OpenProjectClient public API as needed to expose or proxy calls to these owned clients.
• Ensure configuration loading and error handling occur at each step, with clear failure messages if a dependency fails to initialize.
• Document the new ownership hierarchy in code comments and update any architectural diagrams or README sections related to client initialization.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   a. Mock SSHClient, DockerClient, and RailsConsoleClient constructors to verify OpenProjectClient calls them in the correct order with expected parameters.
   b. Assert that OpenProjectClient holds references to each client as private members.
   c. Simulate failures in SSHClient initialization and verify OpenProjectClient propagates or handles errors appropriately.
2. Integration Tests:
   a. Use real client implementations against a test environment to ensure SSHClient connects, DockerClient can perform basic image operations, and RailsConsoleClient can execute a trivial Rails command.
   b. Verify method calls on OpenProjectClient delegate to the correct underlying client.
3. Regression Tests:
   a. Confirm existing functionality that depended on direct instantiation of DockerClient and RailsConsoleClient still works through the new hierarchy.
4. Code Review & Documentation:
   a. Perform peer review focusing on dependency injection correctness and absence of circular dependencies.
   b. Validate that architectural documentation is updated to reflect this new ownership model.
