# Title: Optimize Rails Console Interaction with Adaptive Polling and Prompt Detection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the Rails console client by implementing prompt detection, adaptive polling intervals, and robust error/output parsing to reduce latency and improve reliability.
# Details:
1. Prompt Detection: Introduce regex-based detection of Rails console prompts (e.g., /\[[^\]]+\] \d+:\d+>/ or default IRB prompt) to know precisely when console input is ready.
2. Adaptive Polling: Replace fixed sleep loops with a dynamic polling strategy that begins at 0.05s and increases (linearly or exponentially) up to a maximum of 0.5s when awaiting console responses.
3. Sleep Reduction: Lower the fallback sleep time from 0.5–1.0s to a consistent 0.1s for operations not covered by adaptive polling.
4. Conditional Stabilization: Refactor `stabilize_console` so it only executes when prompt detection fails, preventing redundant stabilization calls.
5. Error Detection: Embed clear start/end markers in console output and employ regex pattern matching to differentiate and capture error blocks (stack traces, exception messages).
6. Output Parsing: Improve the parsing layer to handle multi‐line errors, escaped characters, and ensure clean extraction of both successful responses and error details.
7. Test Updates: Revise existing test cases to align with the new marker format, validate polling intervals, prompt detection, and error extraction logic.

# Test Strategy:
Unit Tests:
• Prompt Detection: Simulate console streams containing valid prompts, false positives, and edge cases; assert the detector returns true only when prompts are ready.
• Polling Behavior: Mock timing functions to verify polling starts at 0.05s and scales up to 0.5s, and that total wait times match expected curves.
• Stabilization Calls: Spy on `stabilize_console` and ensure it is invoked only when prompt detection reports readiness failure.
• Error Parsing: Feed sample console outputs with the new markers and various error formats; assert that the full error block is extracted, with no data loss.
Integration Tests:
• End-to-end: Execute real Rails console commands (e.g., `User.count`, invalid commands) and measure round-trip times; ensure no more than 0.1s sleep overhead when idle.
• CI Pipeline: Run full test suite verifying updated marker format, polling adaptation under different simulated loads, and confirm zero regressions in existing functionality.
