# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Robust Temporary File Handling for File Transfers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a portable, secure, and atomic temporary file handling utility for file transfers that prevents race conditions, collisions, and ensures proper cleanup and error handling across operating systems.
# Details:
• Secure Temporary File Creation: Use platform-native APIs (e.g., Python’s tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile with delete=False) or generate UUID-based file names in a well-known temporary directory. Ensure names are unpredictable and collision-resistant.
• File Locking: Implement advisory locks (fcntl on Unix, msvcrt on Windows) around all read/write operations to serialize access. Provide a cross-platform lock abstraction.
• Atomic Writes: Write data to the temporary file in a write-only mode, fsync after write completion, and perform an atomic rename or replace operation (os.replace) to move the temp file to its final location.
• Cleanup Mechanisms: Register cleanup handlers (atexit or context managers) and catch exceptions during transfer to remove orphaned temp files. Provide a background sweep utility to purge stale files older than a configurable threshold.
• Cross-Platform Considerations: Detect OS at runtime to choose correct lock and filesystem calls; handle path encoding differences; ensure atomic rename semantics across Windows and POSIX.
• Error Handling: Wrap all file operations in try/except blocks, categorize errors (IOError, PermissionError, etc.), log diagnostics, and rethrow exceptions with contextual metadata.
• Documentation: Write usage guidelines and code examples; define best practices for using the utility, including recommended error handling patterns and configuration options.

# Test Strategy:
• Unit Tests: Validate unique name generation with 10,000 iterations to assert no collisions; simulate permission or disk-full errors and verify temp file cleanup.
• Concurrency Tests: Spawn multiple processes/threads to read/write the same target path concurrently; assert that locks serialize operations and no data corruption occurs.
• Atomicity Tests: During write, interrupt the process and verify that no partial files appear in the final directory; confirm that final file is either complete or absent.
• Cross-Platform Validation: Execute integration tests on Windows, Linux, and macOS agents; verify lock behavior, rename semantics, and path handling.
• Cleanup Verification: Create orphaned temp files older than threshold; run sweep utility and assert removal; test atexit handlers by simulating abnormal shutdown.
• Documentation Review: Peer-review documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness; ensure code examples compile and run as expected.
