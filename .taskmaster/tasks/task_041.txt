# Task ID: 41
# Title: Comprehensive Verification of Migration Components for Refactored Client Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a high-priority audit and testing of all migration components to ensure they integrate correctly with the refactored client architecture and comply with our YOLO development approach, exception-based error handling, optimistic execution patterns, and strict Python typing rules.
# Details:
• Identify all migration components and list their entry points, public APIs, and dependencies.
• For each component:
  – Conduct a detailed code review to confirm:
    • YOLO compliance: no legacy support hooks, single-responsibility design, minimal configuration.
    • Exception-based error handling: no return codes or status dictionaries; ensure all error paths raise appropriate exceptions.
    • Optimistic execution: operations execute first, with validation deferred to exception handling; remove any redundant precondition checks.
    • Python typing: full coverage of type annotations (PEP 484) including function signatures, class attributes, and third-party interfaces.
• Document any deviations and refactor code in-line or open follow-up issues for non-compliant patterns.
• Maintain a migration compliance checklist and attach to each pull request for peer review.

# Test Strategy:
• Develop and run dedicated pytest modules for each migration component using commands like:
     pytest tests/test_migration_<component>.py::Test<componentClass> --log-level=DEBUG
• Enable detailed logging in tests (DEBUG level) to capture execution flow, exception stack traces, and type warnings.
• Integrate mypy checks in the CI pipeline:
     mypy src/migration_components/<component>.py
• Automate a compliance report that aggregates:
    – Test pass/fail results
    – Logged exceptions and execution traces
    – Mypy type-check summaries
• Conduct a manual code review session for each component, verifying the compliance checklist and sign-off in pull request comments.
• Mark the task complete only when all components pass automated tests, static analysis, and manual review criteria.
