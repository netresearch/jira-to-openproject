# Task ID: 42
# Title: Fix BatchProcessor timeout handling and test configurations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Correct the timeout parameter handling in BatchProcessor._process_parallel and update test_batch_processor.py to include required constructor parameters for BatchProcessor.
# Details:
1. Review BatchProcessor._process_parallel implementation:
   • Ensure concurrent.futures.as_completed() is invoked with the configured timeout parameter.
   • When a timeout occurs, catch concurrent.futures.TimeoutError and wrap or rethrow as the BatchProcessorTimeout exception (or appropriate error type).
   • Add or adjust unit‐level timeout constants and propagate them correctly to all processing strategies (parallel, hybrid).
2. Audit test_batch_processor.py:
   • Identify missing required config parameters for the BatchProcessor constructor (e.g., max_workers, timeout, retry_strategy) and add defaults in test setup or explicitly pass them in each test.
   • Verify that test_process_items_parallel and test_process_items_hybrid set up workloads that respect the new timeout semantics.
3. Update tests:
   • test_batch_processor_timeout: create a scenario where processing exceeds the timeout and assert the correct exception is raised and contains expected message.
   • test_all_strategies_produce_same_results: ensure all processing strategies (serial, parallel, hybrid) yield identical outputs given a fixed workload and identical configuration.
4. Add logging statements in _process_parallel to record task start/end times and timeout events for easier debugging.
5. Document the default timeout behavior in the class docstring and update the public API docs accordingly.

# Test Strategy:
• Run pytest tests/test_batch_processor.py and confirm all four previously failing tests now pass.
• Create an additional test that monkeypatches a long‐running task (e.g., time.sleep) to validate that _process_parallel raises the expected timeout exception.
• Parameterize tests to run with different timeout values (e.g., very low timeout to force failure and high timeout to ensure success) and assert behavior in both cases.
• For test_all_strategies_produce_same_results, generate a random data set, run each strategy, and assert deep equality of outputs.
• Introduce a performance test that runs batches of 1000 items in parallel and hybrids with timeouts to ensure no regressions in throughput.
