# Task ID: 101
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Caching Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 44, 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize migration performance by implementing intelligent caching, connection pooling, and batch processing optimizations to handle large-scale migrations efficiently.
# Details:
1. Implement Redis-based caching layer:
   - Cache Jira API responses to reduce redundant API calls
   - Cache OpenProject user/role mappings
   - Cache custom field definitions and mappings
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies
2. Optimize database connections:
   - Implement connection pooling for both Jira and OpenProject clients
   - Add connection health checks and automatic reconnection
   - Configure optimal connection timeouts and retry strategies
3. Enhance batch processing:
   - Implement adaptive batch sizes based on response times
   - Add parallel processing for independent operations
   - Implement memory-efficient streaming for large datasets
4. Add performance monitoring:
   - Track API call latencies and success rates
   - Monitor memory usage and garbage collection
   - Implement progress tracking with ETA calculations
5. Optimize file I/O operations:
   - Implement buffered writes for large JSON files
   - Add compression for temporary files
   - Optimize file locking strategies for high concurrency

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance benchmarks: Compare migration times before and after optimizations
2. Memory usage tests: Monitor memory consumption during large migrations
3. Cache hit/miss ratio tests: Verify caching effectiveness
4. Load testing: Test system behavior under high concurrent load
5. Stress testing: Verify system stability during extended migrations
