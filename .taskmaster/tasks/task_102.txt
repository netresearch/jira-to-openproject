# Task ID: 102
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 101
# Priority: high
# Description: Add comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability features to track migration progress, detect issues early, and provide detailed insights into system performance and health.
# Details:
1. Implement structured logging with correlation IDs:
   - Add unique correlation IDs for each migration operation
   - Implement structured JSON logging with consistent schema
   - Add log levels and filtering capabilities
   - Integrate with external log aggregation systems
2. Add metrics collection:
   - Track migration progress (records processed, success/failure rates)
   - Monitor API response times and error rates
   - Track resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
   - Implement custom business metrics
3. Create health check endpoints:
   - Add REST API endpoints for system health monitoring
   - Implement readiness and liveness probes
   - Add dependency health checks (Jira, OpenProject, Redis)
4. Implement alerting system:
   - Configure alerts for critical failures
   - Add performance degradation alerts
   - Implement escalation procedures
5. Create monitoring dashboards:
   - Build Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
   - Add migration progress visualization
   - Create performance trend analysis
6. Add distributed tracing:
   - Implement OpenTelemetry integration
   - Add trace spans for major operations
   - Correlate traces with logs and metrics

# Test Strategy:
1. Log correlation tests: Verify correlation IDs are properly propagated
2. Metrics accuracy tests: Validate collected metrics against actual operations
3. Health check tests: Verify health endpoints return correct status
4. Alerting tests: Test alert generation and delivery
5. Dashboard tests: Verify dashboard data accuracy and real-time updates
