# Task ID: 103
# Title: Implement Advanced Error Recovery and Resilience Patterns
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 102
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the system's resilience by implementing advanced error recovery patterns, circuit breakers, and automatic retry mechanisms to handle transient failures and network issues gracefully.
# Details:
1. Implement circuit breaker pattern:
   - Add circuit breakers for external API calls (Jira, OpenProject)
   - Configure failure thresholds and recovery timeouts
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for circuit open states
   - Add circuit breaker metrics and monitoring
2. Enhance retry mechanisms:
   - Implement exponential backoff with jitter
   - Add retry policies for different types of failures
   - Implement retry budgets to prevent cascading failures
   - Add retry metrics and alerting
3. Implement dead letter queues:
   - Create persistent queues for failed operations
   - Add manual retry capabilities for failed items
   - Implement dead letter queue monitoring and alerting
   - Add dead letter queue processing tools
4. Add graceful degradation:
   - Implement fallback strategies for non-critical operations
   - Add partial success handling for batch operations
   - Implement degradation metrics and alerting
5. Enhance error classification:
   - Categorize errors by type (transient, permanent, user error)
   - Implement different handling strategies per error type
   - Add error correlation and root cause analysis
6. Implement chaos engineering:
   - Add controlled failure injection for testing resilience
   - Create chaos testing scenarios
   - Implement chaos testing automation

# Test Strategy:
1. Circuit breaker tests: Verify circuit opens/closes based on failure patterns
2. Retry mechanism tests: Validate exponential backoff and retry limits
3. Dead letter queue tests: Verify failed operations are properly queued
4. Graceful degradation tests: Test system behavior under partial failures
5. Chaos engineering tests: Verify system resilience under controlled failures
