# Task ID: 104
# Title: Implement Security Hardening and Compliance Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 103
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance security posture by implementing comprehensive security controls, audit logging, and compliance features to meet enterprise security requirements and protect sensitive migration data.
# Details:
1. Implement comprehensive audit logging:
   - Log all authentication and authorization events
   - Track data access patterns and sensitive operations
   - Implement tamper-evident audit logs
   - Add audit log retention and archival policies
2. Enhance authentication and authorization:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication support
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Implement session management and timeout policies
   - Add API key rotation and management
3. Implement data encryption:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest (credentials, migration data)
   - Implement TLS 1.3 for all network communications
   - Add encryption key management and rotation
   - Implement secure credential storage
4. Add security scanning and validation:
   - Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Add container security scanning
   - Implement code security analysis
   - Add runtime security monitoring
5. Implement compliance features:
   - Add GDPR compliance features (data retention, deletion)
   - Implement SOX compliance controls
   - Add audit trail for compliance reporting
   - Implement data classification and handling
6. Add security monitoring and alerting:
   - Implement security event detection
   - Add anomaly detection for suspicious activities
   - Implement security incident response procedures
   - Add security metrics and reporting

# Test Strategy:
1. Security audit tests: Verify all security controls are properly implemented
2. Penetration testing: Conduct security penetration tests
3. Compliance validation: Verify compliance with relevant standards
4. Encryption tests: Validate encryption/decryption functionality
5. Security monitoring tests: Verify security alerts and incident response
