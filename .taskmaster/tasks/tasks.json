        "details": "1. Locate the script generation logic in EnhancedUserAssociationMigrator (lines ~490‚Äì500). Remove direct f-string interpolation of user-controlled values (e.g., jira_key).\n2. Use safe serialization methods: build a Ruby hash and call .to_json, or wrap interpolated values with Ruby‚Äôs %q{} quoting or String#dump.\n   ‚Ä¢ Example replacement:\n     operations << JSON.parse('%s') % { json: { jira_key: jira_key, wp_id: wp_id, status: 'success' }.to_json }\n   OR\n     operations << { jira_key: jira_key.dump, wp_id: wp_id, status: 'success' }\n3. In Python, escape the jira_key and other strings via json.dumps or an equivalent to produce a safe JSON literal.\n4. Add input validation in the Python layer: reject or sanitize jira_key values that contain control characters or exceed allowed patterns (e.g., /^[A-Z0-9\\-]+$/).\n5. Update any helper methods or script builder utilities to centralize escaping logic for future script generations.\n6. Refactor test fixtures and any documentation to reflect the new safe serialization approach.",

Unit tests: for a variety of jira_key inputs (normal, containing single/double quotes, newline characters, and malicious Ruby code), verify that the generated script lines contain properly escaped literals and no unescaped quotes or code.\n2. Integration test: inject a malicious jira_key (e.g., \"'; User.destroy_all; puts 'pwned\") into a dry-run of EnhancedUserAssociationMigrator with a mocked DockerClient (via RailsConsoleClient injection). Assert that the console output does not execute destructive commands and that the operations hash only contains the intended data.\n3. Validation tests: supply invalid jira_key formats and confirm that the code raises a validation error before script generation.\n4. Regression check: re-run existing migration scenarios to ensure no change in behavior for valid inputs.",

Configuration: Add new config entries under `migration.user_mapping`: `rate_limit_per_sec` (default 5), `batch_size` (default 50), `max_retries` (default 5), `circuit_breaker_threshold` (default 10 failures), and `circuit_breaker_timeout` (default 300s).\n2. Rate Limiting: Integrate a token‚Äêbucket or leaky‚Äêbucket limiter (e.g. using a third-party library or custom implementation) around each API call to Jira in `_create_enhanced_mappings()`, respecting `rate_limit_per_sec`.\n3. Exponential Backoff: Wrap the HTTP client calls in an exponential backoff strategy (e.g. using `tenacity`), retrying up to `max_retries` on transient 5xx or rate-limit responses, with jitter to avoid thundering herds.\n4. Batch Processing: Instead of one API call per user, collect user IDs into slices of `batch_size` and use Jira‚Äôs batch‚Äêuser endpoint (if available) or parallelize within rate limits. Map batch responses back to individual users before persisting.\n5. Progress Reporting: Emit progress logs or callback events after each batch (e.g. ‚ÄúProcessed 50/200 users‚Äù) to the existing logging/progress system.\n6. Circuit Breaker: Implement a circuit breaker around API calls that opens after `circuit_breaker_threshold` consecutive failures, sleeps for `circuit_breaker_timeout`, then resets. Fail fast if open.\n7. Edge Cases: Ensure graceful shutdown if unrecoverable errors occur and propagate meaningful exceptions.\n8.

Replace `except Exception` blocks in EnhancedUserAssociationMigrator and EnhancedTimestampMigrator with specific exception handlers (e.g., APIError, ConnectionError, Timeout) and ensure each block logs the original traceback and operation context.  \n2. Refactor the Rails script generation step to detect duplicates using hash-based structures (sets or dictionaries) instead of O(n) linear searches. Maintain a lookup set of seen operations to enforce uniqueness in constant time.  \n3. Introduce a batching mechanism for Rails operations: accumulate operations in configurable batches (e.g., 500 records), flush each batch to disk or database, and then clear the in-memory cache to prevent unbounded growth. Provide a configurable batch size and implement a final flush at completion.  \n4. Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization: verify that user IDs are integers within expected ranges, Jira keys match the expected pattern (e.g., PROJECT-123), and file paths are normalized and confined to a configured directory. Reject or sanitize any input that fails validation, logging a warning with offending data.  \n5. Enhance error logging across both migrators by including contextual metadata (user ID, timestamp value, batch index) in each log entry. Use structured logging (JSON) so that logs can be searched and filtered by component and error type.  \n6.

Field Mapping Tests: Review the actual mapping logic in EnhancedTimestampMigrator and update expected field mapping dictionaries in the tests.
