# SECURITY CHECKLIST - Review before adding any Docker configuration:
# [ ] Is Docker socket mount really needed? (Usually NO - see security docs)
# [ ] Are services running as non-root users?
# [ ] Are secrets in .env file (not hardcoded in compose.yml)?
# [ ] Are unnecessary ports closed?
# [ ] Are resource limits defined?
# [ ] Are volumes properly scoped?
# [ ] Is .env file properly ignored by git?
