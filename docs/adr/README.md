## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures a significant architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:

- Document the "why" behind technical choices
- Provide historical context for future developers
- Enable informed decision-making when revisiting past choices

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
2. **Context**: The situation and constraints that led to the decision
3. **Decision**: The change or choice being made
4. **Consequences**: The results of the decision (both positive and negative)
