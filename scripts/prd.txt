# Jira to OpenProject Migration Tool - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# Overview
The Jira to OpenProject Migration Tool is designed to facilitate a comprehensive, one-time migration of project management data from Jira Server 9.11 to OpenProject 15. It follows a modular, configurable approach to handling various project entities while addressing known API limitations in both systems.

## Problem Statement
Organizations transitioning from Jira Server to OpenProject require a reliable, comprehensive tool to migrate their project management data without information loss. Manual migration is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical for large project repositories.

## Solution
A robust Python-based migration tool that extracts data from Jira, transforms it according to configurable mapping strategies, and loads it into OpenProject using a combination of API calls and direct Rails console integration where necessary.

## Value Proposition
- Preserves project history, relationships, and metadata during migration
- Handles API limitations through advanced integration techniques
- Provides configurable mapping strategies to align with organizational needs
- Offers modular approach to migrate specific components independently
- Includes comprehensive logging and verification mechanisms
- Supports idempotent operation for incremental synchronization

2. Validation: User performs dry run to validate configuration
3. Execution: User initiates migration process
4. Monitoring: User monitors progress through detailed logging
5. Verification: User validates migration results against success criteria
6. Incremental Updates: User periodically runs the tool to synchronize changes from Jira to OpenProject

# Technical Architecture
## System Architecture
The solution employs a layered architecture for interacting with OpenProject:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    OpenProjectClient    │  High-level API for OpenProject operations
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼─────────────┐
│   RailsConsoleClient    │  Handles Rails console interactions
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼─────────────┐
│      DockerClient       │  Manages Docker container operations
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼─────────────┐
│        SSHClient        │  Handles SSH operations to remote servers
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼─────────────┐
│      FileManager        │  Manages file operations and tracking
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Each component migration follows an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pattern:
1. **Extract**: Data is retrieved from Jira and stored locally
2. **Transform**: Data is mapped according to defined strategies
3. **Load**: Transformed data is created in OpenProject

## Implementation Approach
- **Jira Extraction**: Utilizes Jira REST API v2, with optional custom ScriptRunner API endpoints for optimized data retrieval
- **OpenProject Import**: Primarily uses Rails console for comprehensive data import, bypassing API limitations
- **Idempotent Operation**: Implements change detection and state tracking to support multiple runs
- **Data Preservation**: Safeguards existing OpenProject data, including manually imported content
- **Script Generation**: Produces Ruby scripts that can be manually executed when direct Rails console access is unavailable

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python 3.13
- Runtime Environment: Docker (recommended) or direct Python execution
- Key Libraries: `requests`, `httpx`, `rich`, `python-dotenv`, `pyyaml`
- Integration Methods: REST APIs, SSH, Docker, Rails Console

## Integration Points
### Jira Integration
- Jira Server REST API v2
- (Optional) ScriptRunner Add-On for efficient custom field option extraction

### OpenProject Integration

- API access to both systems
- (Optional) SSH access to OpenProject server for direct Rails console integration
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended for operation)
- Python 3.13+ with virtual environment capability

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Migration Sequence
1. **Users** - Foundation for all other entities
2. **Custom Fields** - Required before work packages can be created
3. **Companies/Customers** - Top-level project structure
4. **Projects** - Container for work packages
5. **Issue Types** - Required for work package creation
6. **Statuses** - Required for workflow configuration
7. **Workflows** - Required for proper status transitions
8. **Link Types** - Required for work package relationships
9. **Work Packages** - Core content migration
10. **Tempo Data** - Additional metadata

## Component Dependencies
- User migration must complete before any other migration
- Projects must exist before work packages can be created
- Custom fields must be defined before their values can be set
- Work package types must exist before work packages can be created
- Statuses must be configured before workflows can be defined

# Risks and Mitigations
## API Limitations
### OpenProject:
- **Risk**: Custom fields and work package types require Rails console
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust Rails console integration

- **Risk**: Some fields (author/creation date) cannot be set via API
- **Mitigation**: Use Rails console for these specific fields

- **Risk**: Link types cannot be modified via API
- **Mitigation**: Create custom fields for unmapped link types

### Jira:
- **Risk**: Custom field options retrieval can be slow for large instances
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient batching and caching

- **Risk**: Pagination limits for large datasets
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper pagination handling with error recovery

- **Risk**: API inconsistencies requiring workarounds
- **Mitigation**: Build abstraction layer to normalize responses

## Performance Considerations
- **Risk**: Large datasets processing can be time-consuming
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient batching, parallel processing where appropriate

- **Risk**: API rate limits could slow migration
- **Mitigation**: Configurable rate limiting and retry mechanisms

## Data Integrity Risks
- **Risk**: Partial migrations or failures
- **Mitigation**: Transaction-like operations, detailed logging, clear error states

- **Risk**: Loss of manually imported or modified data in OpenProject
- **Mitigation**: Implement data preservation checks before updates

## Operational Risks
- **Risk**: Unavailable Rails console access
- **Mitigation**: Generate executable Ruby scripts for manual execution

- **Risk**: Network interruptions during long-running operations
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust state tracking and resumable operations
