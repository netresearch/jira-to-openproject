# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Idempotent Operation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop idempotent operation capability that allows running the migration tool multiple times to synchronize changes from Jira to OpenProject over time.
# Details:
Implement the following features:
1. Change detection and tracking to identify modifications in Jira since last run
2. State preservation of previous migration runs
3. Selective update of only changed entities
4. Safeguards to preserve manually imported or modified data in OpenProject
5. Resumable operations in case of interruptions
6. Conflict resolution mechanisms when data has been modified in both systems

# Test Strategy:
Test with repeated migrations of the same data with controlled changes to verify:
1. Only changed items are updated
2. Manually modified data in OpenProject is preserved
3. No duplicate entities are created
4. Proper handling of deleted items in Jira
5. Performance remains consistent across multiple executions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Change Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a system to detect changes in Jira since the last migration run
### Details:
Develop mechanisms to:
1. Store a snapshot of Jira entities after each successful migration
2. Compare current Jira state with the stored snapshot
3. Identify created, updated, and deleted entities
4. Generate a detailed change report
5. Prioritize changes based on entity type and dependencies

## 2. State Preservation Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement mechanisms to preserve the state of previous migration runs
### Details:
Develop a robust state tracking system that:
1. Records the state of each entity after migration
2. Maintains a mapping between Jira and OpenProject entities
3. Preserves historical migration information (timestamps, user, versions)
4. Implements versioned state storage with rollback capability
5. Provides tools for state inspection and verification

## 3. Selective Update System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functionality to selectively update only changed entities
### Details:
Create a system that:
1. Analyzes detected changes to determine update requirements
2. Implements differential update strategies for each entity type
3. Handles entity dependencies during selective updates
4. Provides granular control over what gets updated
5. Optimizes updates to minimize API calls and processing

## 4. Data Preservation Safeguards [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement safeguards to preserve manually imported or modified data in OpenProject
### Details:
Develop protection mechanisms that:
1. Detect manually added or modified data in OpenProject
2. Implement conflict detection between Jira changes and OpenProject changes
3. Create rules to determine precedence in conflict situations
4. Provide merge capabilities for conflicting changes
5. Allow configuration of preservation policies per entity type

## 5. Recovery and Resilience Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement recovery mechanisms for handling interruptions and failures during migration
### Details:
Create resilience features that:
1. Track migration progress at a granular level
2. Implement checkpointing during long-running operations
3. Provide the ability to resume interrupted migrations
4. Create rollback capabilities for failed migrations
5. Implement robust error handling with clear remediation steps
