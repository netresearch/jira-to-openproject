# Task ID: 17
# Title: Enhanced Meta Information Migration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure complete preservation of all meta information during the migration process.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive migration of all meta information including:
1. Watchers
2. Authors and creators
3. Assignees
4. Creation dates
5. Modification dates
6. Reporter information
7. Audit trail data
8. Time tracking information

Use Rails console integration to set fields that cannot be modified via the API, ensuring all metadata is properly preserved during migration.

# Test Strategy:
Test by:
1. Verify all meta information fields are correctly migrated
2. Compare creation/modification dates for accuracy
3. Ensure user associations (author, assignee, watchers) are preserved
4. Validate time tracking and audit information is intact
5. Test with a variety of edge cases (deleted users, special characters, etc.)

# Subtasks:
## 1. User Association Migration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement migration of all user associations (authors, creators, assignees, watchers)

## 2. Timestamp Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement migration of all timestamp metadata (creation dates, modification dates)
### Details:
Develop timestamp preservation mechanisms that:
1. Extract all timestamp metadata from Jira entities
2. Use Rails console integration to set immutable timestamp fields in OpenProject
3. Preserve creation dates exactly as they were in Jira
4. Maintain modification history and last updated dates
5. Create proper audit trail entries in OpenProject with original timestamps

## 3. Audit and History Information [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement migration of audit trails, history, and activity streams
### Details:
Develop comprehensive audit and history migration that:
1. Extracts activity history from Jira entities
2. Converts history entries to OpenProject format
3. Preserves the complete audit trail of changes
4. Migrates activity streams with proper user attribution
5. Creates equivalent history records in OpenProject with original metadata
