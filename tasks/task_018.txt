# Task ID: 18
# Title: Markdown Syntax Conversion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop robust conversion of Jira wiki markup to OpenProject markdown format.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive syntax converter that handles:
1. Jira wiki markup to OpenProject markdown transformation
2. Inline issue references and links (PROJ-123 â†’ #123)
3. User @mentions mapping to OpenProject users
4. Code blocks with language-specific syntax highlighting
5. Complex table structures
6. Embedded images and attachments
7. Jira-specific macros (with appropriate fallbacks)
8. Rich content elements (diagrams, panels, etc.)
9. Preservation of formatting and layout

The conversion must maintain the visual fidelity and functionality of the original content while adapting to OpenProject's markdown dialect.

# Test Strategy:
Test with:
1. A comprehensive set of markup test cases covering all syntax elements
2. Complex real-world examples from production Jira instances
3. Content with embedded macros, attachments, and special formatting
4. Visual comparison of rendered output in both systems
5. Verification of link functionality and reference integrity

## 2. Advanced Markup Conversion [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement conversion of advanced Jira markup to OpenProject markdown

1. Tables with complex formatting
2. Code blocks with syntax highlighting
3. Collapsible sections and details
4. Panel and info/warning/note macros
5. Tabs and dynamic content
6. Color formatting and styling

Handle Jira-specific macros that have no direct equivalent in OpenProject by creating appropriate fallback representations.

2. Update all inline issue links in text content
3. Maintain bidirectional traceability between original references and new ones
4. Handle cross-project references correctly
5. Preserve context and meaning in complex reference patterns
6. Manage references to issues that might not exist in OpenProject

## 4. User Mention Conversion [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement conversion of Jira @username mentions to OpenProject user mentions

Develop a comprehensive user mention conversion system that:
1. Identifies all @username mentions in Jira text content
2. Maps Jira usernames to OpenProject user identifiers
3. Converts mentions to the proper OpenProject format
4. Handles group mentions and special user references
5. Preserves mention functionality in comments and descriptions
6. Gracefully handles mentions of users that don't exist in OpenProject

## 5. Attachment and Embedded Content Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
