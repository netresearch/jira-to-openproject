# Task ID: 19
# Title: Data Preservation and Offline Operation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement mechanisms to preserve existing OpenProject data and support operation when direct Rails console access is unavailable.
# Details:
Develop features to:
1. Detect and preserve manually imported or modified data in OpenProject
2. Generate executable Ruby scripts for manual execution when direct Rails console access is unavailable
3. Implement transaction-like operations with rollback capabilities
4. Create data snapshots before migration operations
5. Provide conflict detection and resolution mechanisms
6. Support out-of-band execution of Rails console commands
7. Generate comprehensive reports on preserved data and manual steps required

This system must work reliably both with direct Rails console access and when operating in a disconnected/offline mode.

# Test Strategy:
Test by:
1. Simulate environments without direct Rails console access
2. Verify generated Ruby scripts execute correctly when run manually
3. Confirm no data loss occurs when manual data exists in OpenProject
4. Test conflict detection with deliberately conflicting data
5. Validate rollback mechanisms restore system to previous state
