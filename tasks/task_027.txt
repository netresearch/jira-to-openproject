# Task ID: 27
# Title: Create client architecture documentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 25, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Draft a comprehensive document in the docs/ directory explaining the new client architecture, including component relationships, responsibilities, and data flow patterns.
# Details:
1. Create a new file docs/client-architecture.md (or docs/client-architecture.adoc) following project documentation conventions.
2. Provide an overview section describing the purpose of the client layer and how it fits into the overall system.
3. Document the key components introduced in Tasks 25 and 26 (OpenProjectClient, SSHClient, DockerClient, RailsConsoleClient), detailing their responsibilities and relationships.
4. Include a visual diagram (e.g., Mermaid or embedded SVG/PNG) illustrating component hierarchy, initialization order (OpenProjectClient → SSHClient, DockerClient, RailsConsoleClient), and data flow patterns for common operations (file transfers, console commands).
5. Outline sequence diagrams or flowcharts for critical interactions (e.g., remote file transfer via SSHClient vs. container transfer via DockerClient).
6. Add code snippets or configuration examples to show how clients are instantiated and used.
7. Reference existing code in src/clients and link to relevant sections in the API reference.
8. Ensure the document adheres to the project’s style guide (headings, formatting, link conventions) and includes a changelog entry.
9. Include a “Further Reading” section linking to Issues/Tickets for Tasks 25 and 26 and any related RFCs or design discussions.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that docs/client-architecture.md exists in the repository and is included in the docs navigation (e.g., sidebar configuration).
2. Render the Markdown/AsciiDoc to confirm the visual diagram displays correctly (automated check via CI for Mermaid rendering or image availability).
3. Review the document against a checklist: overview present, each client component documented, diagram matches actual code structure, data flow patterns clearly explained.
4. Conduct a peer review: assign the document to at least one backend and one frontend engineer to confirm clarity and accuracy.
5. Update documentation links in README or project site and verify broken link checks in CI pass.
6. Cross-reference code: ensure code examples in the document compile without errors and reflect the current implementation of Tasks 25 and 26.
7. Sign off by documentation owner after addressing all review comments.
