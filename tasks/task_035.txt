# Task ID: 35
# Title: Enhance Logging System with TRACE Level
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Introduce a new TRACE log level below DEBUG and refactor existing logs to improve observability while retaining backward compatibility and configurable controls.
# Details:
1. Define TRACE as the lowest severity in the logging enum/constant list and update the loggerâ€™s internal level hierarchy.  
2. Refactor existing DEBUG statements: move verbose, step-by-step operational logs to TRACE; preserve higher-level troubleshooting messages at DEBUG. Ensure consistency across all client classes.  
3. Update log formatting templates to include a clear TRACE indicator (e.g., color or prefix).  
4. Enhance configuration: add a toggle to enable/disable TRACE globally; allow per-module or per-component TRACE filtering via configuration files or environment variables.  
5. Apply the new TRACE level in low-level clients: TmuxClient, RailsClient, SSHClient, and DockerClient. Identify and migrate detailed internal state logs to TRACE.  
6. Update wrapper methods in the logger utility to accept TRACE calls and maintain existing API signatures for backward compatibility.  
7. Document usage: update developer documentation and code comment guidelines with examples on when to use TRACE vs DEBUG, configuration options, and best practices for granular logging.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests: verify the logger emits TRACE messages only when TRACE is enabled; assert formatting includes the TRACE marker.  
2. Configuration Tests: programmatically load configs with TRACE disabled/enabled and confirm that TRACE-level logs appear or are suppressed.  
3. Integration Tests: run sample workflows in TmuxClient, RailsClient, SSHClient, and DockerClient to ensure detailed steps are logged at TRACE and higher-level events at DEBUG.  
4. Module Filtering: test selective enabling of TRACE for a single module and confirm other modules remain at DEBUG.  
5. Backward Compatibility: run existing test suites to ensure no breaking changes in DEBUG and higher levels.  
6. Documentation Review: include a step to verify that developer docs compile correctly and examples produce expected log output.
