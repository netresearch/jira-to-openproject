# Task ID: 38
# Title: Enforce exception-based error handling throughout the codebase
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor code to use exception-based error handling instead of return codes or error objects, covering subprocess.run() and all other Python modules/methods that support similar options.
# Details:
This task aims to make the codebase consistently follow the exception-oriented programming rule, where functions should raise appropriate exceptions rather than returning error codes or status values. This includes:

1. Update subprocess.run() calls to use check=True to properly raise exceptions when execution fails
2. Review and update file operations to use context managers and proper exception handling
3. Ensure JSON parsing uses proper exception handling
4. Update network request code to use raise_for_status() or similar exception-raising methods
5. Review database operations for proper exception handling
6. Identify and update any other methods that have options to raise exceptions instead of returning error codes
7. Refactor any code that checks return values to instead use try/except blocks
8. Ensure all error handling follows our exception-oriented approach throughout the codebase

# Test Strategy:
1. Add unit tests that verify exceptions are properly raised and caught
2. Test both success and failure paths to ensure correct behavior
3. Verify special cases like _session_exists() properly follow the exception pattern
4. Run the full test suite to ensure these changes don't break existing functionality
5. Add specific tests for each category of change (file operations, subprocess calls, etc.)
6. Manually test critical paths to verify proper exception handling
7. Review code coverage of exception handling branches
