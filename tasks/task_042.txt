# Task ID: 42
# Title: Enhance and Standardize Testing Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Reorganize test directories, standardize test configurations, implement consistent mocking patterns, introduce test classification markers, set up coverage reporting, add missing tests, develop an end-to-end suite, and streamline the developer testing experience.
# Details:
1. Directory Reorganization:
   • Restructure the tests/ folder into subdirectories: tests/unit, tests/integration, tests/e2e.
   • Ensure each module’s tests live alongside or mirror production code hierarchy.

2. Configuration Standardization:
   • Introduce a central pytest.ini or setup.cfg with global settings:
     – test paths, python_files pattern, markers definition (unit, integration, e2e).
     – default command-line options (e.g., -ra, --disable-warnings).
   • Document custom ini options and enforce via CI lint.

3. Consistent Mocking Strategy:
   • Adopt a unified mocking approach using pytest fixtures and monkeypatch.
   • Create shared fixtures in tests/conftest.py for common dependencies (database, HTTP, file I/O).
   • Prohibit ad hoc patching in individual tests; document patterns for external service stubs.

4. Test Classification with Markers:
   • Define and register markers in pytest.ini: @pytest.mark.unit, @pytest.mark.integration, @pytest.mark.e2e.
   • Update existing tests with appropriate markers; fail the build if tests are unmarked.
   • Configure CI pipelines to run marker groups selectively (fast unit suite vs. full suite).

5. Coverage Reporting:
   • Integrate pytest-cov to generate HTML and XML coverage reports.
   • Enforce minimum coverage thresholds per directory (e.g., unit ≥90%, integration ≥80%).
   • Publish reports to CI artifact storage and fail on regression.

6. Adding Missing Tests:
   • Audit codebase to identify uncovered modules, prioritize critical paths.
   • Write targeted unit tests for utility functions, business logic, and error paths.
   • Add integration tests to validate interactions with external resources (databases, APIs).

7. End-to-End Test Suite:
   • Develop an E2E suite under tests/e2e using a real-like environment (e.g., Docker, local services).
   • Automate user-flow scenarios via HTTP clients or Selenium/WebDriver for UI components.
   • Parameterize endpoints and credentials via environment variables or fixtures.

8. Developer Experience Improvements:
   • Provide a Makefile or npm scripts: make test:unit, make test:integration, make test:e2e, make coverage.
   • Add pre-commit hooks for running linters, black, and quick unit tests.
   • Update CONTRIBUTING.md with testing guidelines and examples.


# Test Strategy:
1. Directory and Config Validation:
   • CI job checks that tests/ contains subdirectories unit, integration, e2e.
   • Lint pytest.ini for required settings and marker registrations.

2. Marker Coverage and Enforcement:
   • Run pytest with --strict-markers to ensure no unregistered markers.
   • Fail if any test lacks a marker or is misclassified.

3. Mocking Consistency:
   • Review tests to confirm usage of shared fixtures vs. ad hoc patches.
   • Automated code scan (grep or AST script) to detect direct use of mock.patch without fixture.

4. Coverage Thresholds:
   • Execute pytest-cov; assert coverage percentages meet thresholds.
   • Verify HTML and XML reports are generated and stored.

5. Functional Test Runs:
   • Run make test:unit, test:integration, test:e2e locally and in CI; all must pass.
   • E2E suite must complete full user-flow scenarios against a staging environment.

6. New Test Verification:
   • Use coverage analysis to confirm that previously uncovered code paths are now covered.
   • Peer review of added tests to ensure quality and adherence to patterns.

7. Developer Onboarding:
   • Fresh clone to a dev machine; follow CONTRIBUTING.md steps to run full test matrix.
   • Confirm pre-commit hooks trigger expected linters and unit tests before commit.

8. CI Integration:
   • Ensure subdivided CI stages (unit/integration/e2e) run in the correct order and gate promotions.
   • Introduce fail-fast for unit stage to speed feedback.


# Subtasks:
## 1. Reorganize Test Directory Structure [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a clear separation between test types by reorganizing the test directory.
### Details:
- Create separate directories for unit, functional, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Move existing tests to appropriate directories
- Add README.md files explaining each test category's purpose
- Create utils directory for shared test helpers

## 2. Implement Standard Test Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None

- Refactor existing tests to use consistent mocking
- Add documentation for mocking best practices

## 4. Add Test Classification with Pytest Markers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement pytest markers to categorize and organize tests by type and requirements.

- Apply markers to all existing tests
- Add custom marker for tests requiring Docker
- Update documentation with marker usage guidelines

## 5. Implement Coverage Reporting [done]

- Create helper functions to standardize monkeypatch patterns
- Update existing tests to work with monkeypatched dependencies
- Add examples and documentation for proper monkeypatching
- Ensure proper teardown/cleanup of mocks between tests

## 10. Refine Environment Configuration Loading During Test Execution [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the test framework properly controls environment configuration loading during test execution, including proper handling of .env, .env.local, .env.test, and .env.test.local files.
### Details:
1. Verify and refine the existing environment loading system to:
   - Detect when tests are running (via pytest environment or explicit flags)
   - Properly load `.env.test` and `.env.test.local` during test execution in addition to base configs
   - Maintain proper precedence in the existing hierarchy

2. Add a pytest fixture that:
   - Controls whether tests run with test-specific environment variables
   - Allows tests to temporarily override specific environment variables
   - Resets environment after each test to ensure test isolation

3. Update environment-dependent tests to use this fixture
   - Ensure tests aren't affected by developer's local environment
   - Allow specific tests to opt-out of test environment if needed

**Test Strategy**:
- Verify environment detection works correctly in pytest context
- Confirm test configuration takes precedence during test runs
- Test that isolation between test cases is maintained
