# Tasks 101-110 Implementation Plan

## Overview
Systematic implementation of 10 critical enhancement tasks (101-110) for the Jira to OpenProject migration tool, following the "plan, implement, review, fix findings, commit" approach.

## Current Status: IMPLEMENTATION PHASE - Tasks 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108 COMPLETED

### Task Dependencies (from PRD)
- **Tasks 101-103**: Foundational tasks (implement first)
- **Tasks 104-106**: Depend on error recovery system (Task 101)
- **Tasks 107-109**: Can be developed in parallel
- **Task 110**: Should be completed last (documentation)

- [ ] **Task 106**: Implement Rollback and Undo Capabilities

### Phase 3: Configuration and Security (107-109)
- [ ] **Task 107**: Add Configuration Management and Templates
- [x] **Task 108**: Implement Advanced Security Features ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] Plan: Design comprehensive security framework with encryption, audit logging, access control
  - [x] Implement: Advanced security system with encryption, credential management, audit logging, RBAC, rate limiting, security scanning
  - [x] Review: Test security functionality (38/38 tests passing)
  - [x] Fix: Fixed rate limiter datetime issue and added missing dependencies
  - [x] Commit: Ready for commit
- [ ] **Task 109**: Add Integration Testing Framework

### Phase 4: Documentation (110)
- [ ] **Task 110**: Create User Documentation and Training Materials

## Current Focus: Task 109 - Add Integration Testing Framework

### Task 101 Summary - COMPLETED ✅
**Error Recovery System Implementation:**
- ✅ Comprehensive error recovery with tenacity, pybreaker, SQLAlchemy
- ✅ Checkpointing system with database models for resume functionality
- ✅ Circuit breaker pattern for external service protection
- ✅ Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- ✅ Structured logging with structlog
- ✅ 13/13 tests passing
- ✅ Integration with base migration system
- ✅ Ready for production use

### Task 108 Summary - COMPLETED ✅
**Advanced Security Features Implementation:**
- ✅ Comprehensive security framework with encryption, audit logging, access control
- ✅ EncryptionManager with symmetric/asymmetric encryption and password hashing
- ✅ CredentialManager for secure credential storage and retrieval
- ✅ AuditLogger for comprehensive security event logging
- ✅ AccessControlManager with role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ RateLimiter for API rate limiting and protection
- ✅ SecurityScanner for input validation and threat detection
- ✅ SecurityManager as unified interface for all security features
- ✅ Integration with main migration system
- ✅ 38/38 tests passing
- ✅ Ready for production use

### Next Steps for Task 109
1. Design comprehensive integration testing framework
2. Implement end-to-end testing capabilities
3. Add automated test orchestration
4. Create test reporting and analytics
5. Test integration testing functionality

## Success Metrics (from PRD)
- Migration success rate > 99%
- Performance improvement > 50% for large datasets
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Reduction in support requests by 30%
- Average migration time reduced by 40%

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations
- Must support Python 3.9+
- Must work with existing Jira and OpenProject versions
- Must not require changes to target OpenProject systems
